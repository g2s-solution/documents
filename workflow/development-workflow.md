## Daily Workflow

### Morning
1. **Daily Standup** (15 minutes)
   - What did you do yesterday?
   - What will you do today?
   - Any blockers?

### Development
1. **Task Selection**
   - Pick task from sprint board
   - Update task status
   - Create feature branch

2. **Development Process**
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
       A[Select Task] --> B[Create Branch]
       B --> C[Development]
       C --> D[Local Testing]
       D --> E[Push Changes]
       E --> F[Create PR]
       F --> G[Code Review]
       G --> H[Merge]
   ```

3. **Code Review Process**
   - Self-review checklist
   - Peer review
   - Address feedback
   - Merge when approved

### Testing
1. **Testing Process**
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
       A[Test Plan] --> B[Unit Tests]
       B --> C[Integration Tests]
       C --> D[E2E Tests]
       D --> E[Performance Tests]
       E --> F[Security Tests]
   ```

2. **Quality Gates**
   - Code coverage > 80%
   - All tests passing
   - No security vulnerabilities
   - Performance benchmarks met

## Communication Channels

### Team Communication
